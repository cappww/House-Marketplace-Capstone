# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

There are two versions of the project that I made. "master" has the completed boilerplate code along with the required tests as found in the rubric for this project. However, when I attempted to submit these contracts to OpenSea, they were not ERC721 compliant. That is why I made the "opensea-submission" version which imports openzeppelin's ERC721 contracts and is compliant to OpenSea while still using zokrates.

Use the 'mint.js' script to add an additional token to the marketplace.
